                    We were both in a circle of friends where mostly of us are high school batchmates, around 30s and
                    single.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During pandemic days, everyone was returning to province and working from home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We often setup a weekend eat-out, hang out and road trips. We were just having the best in our lives
                    and not rushing ourselves into finding romantic relationships.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When our friends started pairing us up and teasing us, that's when things got complicated.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Personally, I would not want to be romantically linked to a "friend" and I would never date one. I
                    always respect boundaries and I don't want any complications in the end in case relationship doesn't
                    work.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started feeling awkward on our succeeding group dates and started noticing even the smallest
                    details about him. Little did I know, I was already falling for him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He's a good person and a true gentleman. I remember chatting with him few times from the past, just
                    having casual conversations as a friend. We used to play online games together as well. If I hadn't
                    had any feelings, I would think that those are just normal as friends. But everything from the past
                    started flashing out in my memories. I remember playing with him back in the kindergarten with his
                    twin brother. He transferred to other school so I wasn't able to see him for a couple of years not
                    until they transferred back to our school. He became my seatmate as well in first high school but we
                    were not really close.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I know my feelings for him started to grow until I could't contain it anymore. As an independent
                    woman, I was firm to my decision that I would NEVER confess to a man. I took advantage of having
                    supportive girlfriends, so I confess to them instead.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But no secrets remain hidden and I know he had hint already. Gosh! The confessions were so intensed
                    that I don't want to be in detailed anymore lol. Bottomline, we decided to remain as friends.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I started drifting away. Even if we remain friends, I know things will never be the same.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Good thing it happened in December, which means by January it will be "New Year, New Me!". Yup, I
                    have moved on that quickly. Feeling's erased.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But wait, there's a major plot twist. ðŸ˜‚ I attended my cousin's daughter baptism and birthday party.
                    Some of our batchmates from high school were invited, it was a mini reunion. Few of my cousin's
                    friends were invited as well. But me as a single, everyone was pairing me up to whoever was single
                    too. I tried to play cool. The environment was so light and bubbly so it won't hurt if I will just
                    go with the flow. I met few single boys. I thought that was a good start. I was even invited to go
                    out by my other batchmate who was single too.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was there too. But his presence doesn't affect me anymore, truly means I was moved on from him.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The night I went home, I received a chat from him. That sounded fishy to me as we were not talking
                    for weeks already. I didn't go to group dates anymore just to avoid him. I didn't expect that there
                    was a Part 2 of the confessions we had, something spicier this time haha.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He was telling me how he assessed our situation and feelings, how he realized that he was falling
                    with me already and doesn't want us to be just friends. Shookt!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He asked for another chance, he wanted to pursue me. I wasn't sure of my feelings. If only he
                    confessed at an earlier time, I would have immediately said yes. This is not me playing easy to get
                    but I wouldn't let a person court me for a long time if I don't have plans saying yes to him. But
                    that was a different story. In the end, we decided to give it a try.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "She fell first, he fell harder" Kind Of Story
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The two of us started going out. First few dates are kinda awkward, given that we used to hang out
                    with a group of friends, but just the two of us seems different. But the good thing is, we were able
                    to know each other more, discuss our personal issues and most importantly, decide to take a risk in
                    leveling up our relationship from friends to lovers. And the rest is history.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Everything went very smoothly for us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I didn't expect that the little boy from the kindergarten I used to play with, the young man I used
                    to sit with in the 1st year in high school and one of my barkada will end of becoming my husband.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am more excited to what's in store for us.
